# level3_Pokemon

<!-- Made som assumptions during development that resulted in broken code. Example, did many API calls and assumed from results that ability descriptions were always listed in the same language order: Language = ["ge", "en"]. But this changes at times. Also assumed that all pokemon had 2 abilities. Some have only 1, so need to refactor and take that into account.
