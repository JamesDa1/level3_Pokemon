# level3_Pokemon

Using the Pokeapi to display pokemon, works with ID and name.
Try: 11, 12, 123 to see pokemon with 1, 2 and 3 abilities

Todo:

- Clean the stylesheet, remove duplicates and redundant code.
- Improve styling
  - Example, create div for abilities, so that they can be automatically centered regardless of 1, 2 or 3 abilities
